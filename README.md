This is a multiple choice Geography quiz game that utilizes the Trivia API to get questions and answers. Users can choose any number of questions, starting from 1 to 275 questions(I dare you to do 275!). The questions are of varying levels of difficulty. After each question, a player can choose to quit or continue.
